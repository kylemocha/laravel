                            Mental health is a state of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses of life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and contribute to their community. It is an integral component of health and well-being that underpins our individual and collective abilities to make decisions, build relationships and shape the world we live in. Mental health is a basic human right. And it is crucial to personal, community and socio-economic development.
                            Mental health is more than the absence of mental disorders. It exists on a complex continuum, which is experienced differently from one person to the next, with varying degrees of difficulty and distress and potentially very different social and clinical outcomes.<br>

                            This should be done through community-based mental health care, which is more accessible and acceptable than institutional care, helps prevent human rights violations and delivers better recovery outcomes for people with mental health conditions. Community-based mental health care should be provided through a network of interrelated services that comprise:

                            <ul style="font-size: 18px;" class="description wow fadeInLeftBig">
                                <li>mental health services that are integrated in general health care, typically in general hospitals and through task-sharing with non-specialist care providers in primary health care;</li>
                                <li>community mental health services that may involve community mental health centers and teams, psychosocial rehabilitation, peer support services and supported living services;</li>
                                <li>services that deliver mental health care in social services and non-health settings, such as child protection, school health services, and prisons.</li>
